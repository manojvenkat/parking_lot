1. Design - Parking Lot, User, Ticket, Slot, Car etc. 
2. Then model-methods to park a car, empty a slot etc.
3. Write lib functions for parsing stuff.
4. Write rake tasks with meaningful names. Make sure the main code lies in the model methods only.
5. Tests. Unit tests please!!! Don't forget.
5. Write minimal controller actions to emulate the CLI so that a front-end client can be attached. Can be a mobile app or an JS framework. - Low priority.

Testing Action plan: 
1. Test models - Validation, low-level methods and then high level methods. 
2. Try generating fixtures or write a fixture generator. Can use the existing test file to generate the fixture.
