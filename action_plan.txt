1. Design - Parking Lot, User, Ticket, Slot, Car etc. 
2. Then model-methods to park a car, empty a slot etc.
3. Write lib functions for parsing stuff.
4. Write rake tasks with meaningful names. Make sure the main code lies in the model methods only.
5. Tests. Unit tests please!!! Don't forget.
5. Write minimal controller actions to emulate the CLI so that a front-end client can be attached. Can be a mobile app or an JS framework. - Low priority.
6. Try out elasticsearch and make it fast for querying. Assuming the parking lot is huge and to be made scalable.
7. Dockerize it!
